### `Phase 1`

    1- Used `mocklab.io` for fake api
    2-  { d_time: 43
        res_cusines: (2) ["South Indian", "Chinies"]
        res_id: 1
        res_image: "https://res.cloudinary.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_508,h_320,c_fill/dsc5qezmzknfydpyc8z6"

        res_rating: 4.3 }
    3- Took images from Swiggy portal

### `Phase 2`

Deciding Tech stack > Going with React + Redux for current requirments

### `Phase 3`

Decided what screen need to target first 
    > Going with Mobile first design approach
    > Screen is compactible with 768px less than all screen and greater too.


### `Phase 4 (Initialized basic project setup part )`   

    Using create-react-app to create boiler plate 
    installed required packages like react-redux, redux-thunk etc.
    Decided project folder structure and Component structure
    Going with one stateless and statefull component styling
    Created 5 component like  > 
                                * Main Component
                                * Header Component
                                * Footer Component
                                * Search Component
